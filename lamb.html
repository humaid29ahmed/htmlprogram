<p><strong>
   The Lamborghini Gallardo (/ɡaɪˈjɑːrdoʊ/; Spanish: [ɡaˈʎaɾðo]) is a sports car built by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013.
   It is Lamborghini's second car released under parent company Audi, and best-selling model with 14,022 built throughout its production run.
   [8] Named after a famous breed of fighting bull,[9] the V10 powered Gallardo has been Lamborghini's sales leader and stable-mate to a succession 
   of V12 flagship models—first to the Murciélago (4,099 built between 2001 and 2010), then to the current flagship, the Aventador, being the 
   first entry-level Lamborghini in one-and-half decades. On 25 November 2015, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line. 
   The Gallardo was replaced by the Huracán in 2014.<strong>
